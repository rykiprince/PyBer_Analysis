# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
By using Python and Matplotlib, analyze all the rideshare data from January to April of 2019 and create visualization charts for PyBer CEO to improve their ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved clients.
## Results
### The correlation of ride-sharing fares to City Types and driver count.

Summaries from the chart above:
- Urban City has the greatest number of rides and drivers. Rural has the smallest number of rides and drivers.
- Urban City has the lowest average fares per ride and per driver. Rural has the highest average fares per ride and per driver.
- Urban City has the highest total fares. Rural has the lowest total fares.
- During this period, comparing to other city types, PyBer is more popular in **Urban Cities**, get more total fares, but with lower average fare per ride and per driver.
- During this period, comparing to other city types, PyBer is not that popular in used in **Rural Cities**, get less total fares, but with higher average fare per ride and per driver.

### Total Weekly of the Fares for Each Type of City

Summary from the chart above:

Among different city types, total fare for each city types are pretty **steady** from January to April. **Urban Cities** consistanly having the highest total fare during the whole period comparing to both Suburban cities and rural cities.
## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

1. Most of the rides and fares are generated by urban cities, which indicate that urban cities are the cities where have the highest demand among different city types. Thus, PyBer should aim to expand the access in urban cities as it would be the biggest part of the business operation.
2. Currently, rural cities have the smallest number of rides and drivers. To improve the operation in rural cities, PyBer can reinforce to expand the driver group.
3. Providing more favorable price in rural cities to attract more potential neighbors may also help PyBer to improve their ride-sharing services, because it's now way more higher than the urban cities fare. The higher fare also lower its competitiveness in rural cities.
